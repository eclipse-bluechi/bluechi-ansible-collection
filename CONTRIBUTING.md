## Eclipse Contributor Agreement

In order to be able to contribute to Eclipse Foundation projects you must
electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php).

The ECA provides the Eclipse Foundation with a permanent record that you agree
that each of your contributions will comply with the commitments documented in
the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Having an ECA on file associated with
the email address matching the "Author" field of your contribution's Git commits
fulfills the DCO's requirement that you sign-off on your contributions.

For more information, please see the [Eclipse Committer Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit)
